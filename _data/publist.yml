  abstract: The predictive maintenance of rotating machines helps to prevent economic loss and personal damage. Vibrational data of bearing is used to measure the early-stage faults but sometimes this vibrational data consists of many unwanted sig-nals that need to be removed before applying the signal processing techniques. This paper proposes an algorithm to design a dynamic filter that can adjust its bandwidth and central frequency according to different faults that occurs in the rotating bearing. The harmony search algorithm is used to optimize the bandpass filter parameters according to the faults and the short-time Fourier trans-form-based Spectral Kurtosis helps measure the strength of fault frequencies. The filter parameters are selected that correspond to the maximum value of the short-time Fourier transform-based Spectral Kurtosis. The simulation results verify the per-formance of the proposed algorithm."

  abstract: This paper studies the bipartite containment control for first-order multi-agent systems. Transformation matrix is employed to show that bipartite containment control can be transformed to common containment control problem. It is proven that if the graph is structurally balanced and for every follower, a directed path from a leader exist, then bipartite containment control problem can be solved and the followers of first group achieve the final position within the convex hull formed by the leaders whereas the followers of second group make bipartition within the exact opposite convex hull formed by the leaders. Finally, numerical simulation is given for illustration."
